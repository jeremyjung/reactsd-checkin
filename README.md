## React Check-in Application

This is just a placeholder for an application that can be used to check-in attendees to React SD meetups.

### Installation

1.  `yarn install`
2.  Set meetup API key environment variable `export MEETUP_API_KEY=<FILL_IN_KEY_HERE>`

### Running

*  `yarn start`

### Importing members from meetup
Note that after running this, the node process will never quit so you'll have to hit ctrl-c after import is complete.  See:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27641764/how-to-destroy-firebase-ref-in-node

*  `yarn run import`
